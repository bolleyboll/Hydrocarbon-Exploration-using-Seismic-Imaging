Seismic-data interpretation has as itâ€™s main goal the identification of compartments, faults, fault sealing, and trapping mechanism that hold hydrocarbons; it additionally tries to understand the depositional history of the environment to describe the relationship between seismic data and a priori geological information. Finding hydrocarbons through salt detection has been an intricate process, ever since they images salt the first time. Salt bodies form oil traps, which form potential reserves for hydrocarbons. This forms the basis for the motivation behind hydrocarbon sensing via salt detection. Seismic data interpreters are used to interpreting on 2D or 3D images that have been heavily processed. In our problem statement we our dealing with data that is less noisy which is an added advantage. Our solution to the problem is to basically use U-Nets which have shown state of the art results on image segmentation. Each pixel in the image is checked for the presence of salt and further on this is how the proportion of salt in that seismic image is calculated. The energy function is computed by a pixel-wise soft-max over the final feature map combined with the binary cross entropy loss function. Our model boasts an accuracy of 94.7% which is significantly higher than that of in the previous implementations.
